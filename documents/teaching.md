On the rightmost column, we list the member of the teaching team that will take final responsibility for answering questions posted on the [course-materials Gitlab Issues page](https://gitlab.msu.edu/cse477-spring-2022/course-materials/-/issues).



## Steps to get help:

If  you need help, please follow these three steps, in order:

1. First, [post an Issue to the Course Gitlab](https://gitlab.msu.edu/cse477-spring-2022/course-materials/-/issues); please use appropriate labels.
2. If needed, attend office hours with the Teaching Assistants. (see table above)
3. If all else fails, contact the course Instructor



### How to structure your Gitlab Issues:

When reaching out for help about software bugs, please provide: 

* <u>Summary:</u> Summarize the problem encountered concisely
* <u>Steps to reproduce:</u> Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important
* <u>What is the current bug behavior:</u> Describe what actually happens
* <u>What is the expected correct behavior</u>:  Describes what you want to happen
* <u>Relevant logs and/or screenshots:</u> Share any relevant logs - please use code blocks to format console output, logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise. If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem.
