# [Web Application Development](https://gitlab.msu.edu/cse477-spring-2022/course-materials/): Homework Assignments



## Assignments

In the table below, we provide an overview of the 5 assignments due in this course. The assignments are due approximately once a month. Each assignment's requirements (except the Course Exam) builds on the prior assignment, so it's very important that you complete each assignment correctly, and on-time. You should be able to complete each assignment with relative ease if you **start early**, and  **watch the lectures**.  Solutions to the assignments will not be provided at any point during the course.

<u>NOTE:</u> All due dates are at 11:59PM EST on the due date shown in the above table.



#### Submission:

All assignments are deemed submitted when:

1. Relevant code for the assignment is committed to the course Gitlab repository.
2. Relevant homework form has been submitted.

See the requirements documents for each assignemnt for more specific details.



#### Grading:

Each assignment will be graded following its corresponding rubric (see table above). Your grades will be shared as an "Issue" in your personal course repository within two weeks on the submission deadline. In the unlikely event of an error in grading you're assignment, you will have 24 hours to request a regrade. Requests made after this time will not be considered. 



**You will receive a 0 on your assignment if your assignment**: 

* Was not submitted in its entirety
* Doesn't compile
* Is non-functional
* Is late
* Is plagiarized, borrowed, or copied



#### Grade Adjustments:

Your lowest grade in the set of assignments {1, 2, 3} will be replaced with your next lowest grade in that same set of assignments (i.e. assignments {1, 2, 3}). For example: if you made a 0%, 90%, and 70% in Homework 1, 2, and 3 respectively - then your grade for Homework 1 would be changed from a 0% to a 70%.
